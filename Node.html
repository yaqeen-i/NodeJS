        // defer attribute ensures that the script is executed after the document has been parsed
        // This is where you can add your JavaScript code
        // For example, you can manipulate the DOM or add event listeners here
        // defer allows the script to run after the HTML is fully loaded
        // defer is useful for scripts that do not need to block the rendering of the page
        // You can also use the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before
        // executing your script
        // defer is a good practice for performance optimization

        // but this may not guarantee the order of execution if there are multiple
